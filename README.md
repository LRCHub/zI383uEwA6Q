[00:00.05] Hello, new world
[00:01.64] All the boys and girls
[00:03.31] I got some true stories to tell
[00:06.75] You're back outside
[00:08.60] But they still lied
[00:10.38] Whoa-oh-oh-oh (yeah)
[00:20.38] 
[00:14.16] Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
[00:17.69] Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
[00:21.04] Take off the weird ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm takin' off top five
[00:24.18] Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (take that shit off)

[00:27.82] Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (take that shit off)
[00:31.45] Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (take that shit off)
[00:34.76] Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (take that shit off)
[00:38.01] Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (take it off)
[01:19.01]

[00:45.15] Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (take it off)
[00:48.53] Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
[00:51.68] Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

[01:09.05] The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
[01:11.53] The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
[01:15.03] Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us

[01:25.37] All my decendents, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (huh, facts)
[01:28.62] I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal
[01:30.51] Done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
[01:32.41] You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries
[02:15.41]
